## API

### `onLayout({ element: Object }): void`
Called everytime the component is rendered or updated. Default: `() => {}`.

### `onError({ element: Object, error: Error }): void`
Called if the request to load the image failed. Default: `() => {}`.

### `onLoad({ element: Object }): void`
Called after the load ended (either successfully or not). Default: `() => {}`.

### `onLoadEnd({ element: Object }): void`
Called after the load ended successfully. Default: `() => {}`.

### `onLoadStart({ element: Object }): void`
Called when the request started. Default: `() => {}`.

### `onAbort({ element: Object }): void`
Called if the load of the image was aborted. Default: `() => {}`.

### `onProgress({ element: Object }): void`
Called everytime the AJAX progress event is dispatched. Default: `() => {}`.

### `offset: ?number`
Set the amount of pixel near the viewport the component should be to start the image load. Default: `0`.

### `source: string`
The image source path to load.

### `defaultSource: ?string`
The default image source path or base64. If isn't defined then it uses a SVG animated spinner.

### `type: ?string`
The format type of the image (`png`, `svg+xml`, `jpg` or `gif`). Default: `*`.

### `minLoaded: ?number`
The minimum download percentaje to avoid aborting the request if the image leaves the viewport. Default: `50`.

## Common `img` attributes
This component allow the usage of common `img` attributes like `alt`, `width`, `className`, etc. So you can use it as a normal `img` tag, just change `src` to `source` and (if you want to) add the other optional props.
